</ol>

<h5 id="law2:requirements">Law 2: Requirements</h5>

<ol>
<li>A PLEDGE must complete the following requirements before he will be considered for initiation:

<ol>
<li>Complete the entire New Member Education program and then pass the Chapter and International tests over the material.</li>
<li>Design and construct a paddle and have it signed by each ACTIVE BROTHER and PLEDGE. The paddle should be designed as to allow it to be easily hung up on display and carried around by the PLEDGE. The paddle should be completed and all signatures collected a minimum of two weeks before the initiation ceremony.</li>
<li>Attend a PLEDGE outing planned by the ACTIVE BROTHERHOOD by which time the PLEDGE class shall have elected a PLEDGE class, set the PLEDGE dues, and chosen a big BROTHER if they have not already done so.</li>
<li>Pay his PLEDGE dues.</li>
<li>Participate in one or more philanthropy events (to be approved by the philanthropy chairman) totaling not less than 10 hours.</li>

<li>Have a minimum GPA of 2.2 for the previous semester.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The Psi Upsilon Pledge Pin must be worn at all times except when it is impractical, such as during participation in athletic events or while sleeping.</li>
<li>A PLEDGE must complete the entire initiation Ritual.</li>
<li>ACTIVE BROTHERS, BROTHERS on PERSONAL LEAVE, and ALUMNI who had held ACTIVE status during the most recently concluded Fall or Spring semester and are present at the voting meeting are referred to in this law as the &#8220;ELIGIBLE BROTHERHOOD&#8221;. In order for a PLEDGE to be initiated, he must be voted into the brotherhood by the ELIGIBLE BROTHERHOOD. Only PLEDGES that have met all of the requirements in part one of this section will be considered. There will be no more than 3 meetings per calendar year where a vote is taken to initiate PLEDGE(S), and no fewer than 1, provided that there exist any MEMBERs with PLEDGE status. The process for conducting the vote on the initiation of PLEDGES is as follows:

<ol>
<li>A vote, by secret ballot, will be taken of the ELIGIBLE BROTHERHOOD. Three types of votes may be cast for this ballot:

<ol>
<li>YES - The voting BROTHER wishes the PLEDGE to be initiated into Psi Upsilon.</li>
<li>NO - The voting BROTHER wishes for the PLEDGE to maintain his PLEDGE status and not be initiated at this time.</li>
<li>VETO - The voting BROTHER has irreconcilable issues with the PLEDGE and strongly opposes his initiation at this time.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Non-personal vote totals are to be recorded for the purpose outlined in Way 3. Any such results must be obliterated before any other PLEDGE may be initiated. They will consist of the total votes cast in each of the three categories (YES, NO, or VETO).</li>
<li>After each vote, the votes will be tallied and interpreted as follows:

<ol>
<li>If the pledge receives a THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY of YES votes from the ELIGIBLE BROTHERHOOD and zero votes of VETO, then the pledge is initiated.</li>
<li>If the pledge receives ten percent (rounded down, to a minimum of 2) or greater votes of VETO on a single vote tally, then the remainder of the votes (consisting of YES and NO votes) is discarded, and the PLEDGE is not initiated. A motion to EXPEL the PLEDGE will immediately be placed on the table to be discussed at the next regularly scheduled Brother&#8217;s meeting. The procedure for this vote is outlined in Section 5 Law 1 of these Bylaws.</li>
<li>If the pledge receives any votes of VETO below the threshold in part &#8216;ii&#8217; and/or fails to earn a THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY of YES votes from the ACTIVE BROTHERHOOD, then discussion is reopened. Following this discussion, a second vote will occur. The procedure for this vote shall differ from the first in following Ways:

<ol>
<li>If the PLEDGE receives no votes of VETO, but does not receive a 3/4 majority of YES votes, then the pledge is not initiated.</li>
<li>If the PLEDGE receives between one and 10 per cent votes of VETO, and this is not a third or later vote on the same PLEDGE during the same meeting, then the remainder of the votes is discarded and discussion is reopened. Following this discussion another vote will occur by the procedure in Way 3.</li>
<li>If the vote is a third or greater vote, and the total results have not changed from the previous vote, then this will be the final vote and the results stand. In this case, any remaining votes of VETO will be counted as NO votes. A THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY of YES votes from the ELIGBLE BROTHERHOOD are required to initiate, as per normal procedure.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li>During each PLEDGE TERM, a single screening vote will be taken according to the following procedure.

<ol>
<li>Each ACTIVE BROTHER will cast one vote per PLEDGE by secret ballot.

<ol>
<li>A vote of YES indicates that the Brother casting it would like the PLEDGE in question to continue his or her pledge process.</li>
<li>A vote of ABSTAIN removes the Brother casting it from the voting population. This should be taken to mean that the Brother casting it does not know the PLEDGE in question well enough to form an opinion about him or her.</li>
<li>A vote of NO indicates that the Brother casting it would like the PLEDGE in question to be released from his or her pledge process.</li>
<li>A vote of STRONG NO indicates that the Brother casting it has a serious opposition to the PLEDGE in question continuing and that trying to address the issues prompting the vote has yielded no (or negative) results.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Totals for each PLEDGE shall be calculated.</li>
<li>Any PLEDGE receiving at least 50 per cent votes of YES, AND fewer than 20 per cent (rounded down) votes of STRONG NO, will continue his or her pledge process.</li>
<li>Any PLEDGE receiving fewer than 50 per cent votes of YES, OR at least 20 per cent (rounded down) votes of STRONG NO, will be released from his or her pledge process.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any PLEDGE who does not get initiated in one PLEDGE TERM and wishes to continue their pledgeship must do the following:

<ol>
<li>Have their pledgeship renewed by the BROTHERHOOD within one month of the start of the PLEDGE TERM.</li>
<li>Re-complete the requirements outlined above under PLEDGE requirements. Re-completion of any or all of these requirements may be waived by a simple majority vote of the BROTHERHOOD.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<h5 id="law3:rightsandprivileges">Law 3: Rights and Privileges</h5>

<ol>
<li>PLEDGEs may not attend any portion of a meeting that deals with matters of membership, initiation, the Ritual, or any other secret business of the chapter.</li>
<li>PLEDGEs may not take part in any official vote.</li>
<li>During the PLEDGE period each PLEDGE should be made to feel that he has a part in the affairs of the Chapter. The PLEDGEs should be encouraged to take an active part in the social professional and athletic programs of the Chapter. PLEDGEs should be to visit the Chapter House frequently to associate with the MEMBERs.</li>
<li>PLEDGEs shall be encouraged to take part in special or routine work of a constructive nature in and about the Chapter House to the advantage of the Chapter.</li>
<li>There shall be NO activity or function required of a PLEDGE by any MEMBER of Psi Upsilon which violates the precepts of Psi Upsilon, the National Constitution, the Chapter bylaws, or which violates any national, state, or university laws or regulations.</li>
<li>If a conflict of interest exists between a PLEDGE and his big brother, as determined by a SIMPLE MAJORITY of the ACTIVE BROTHERHOOD, the PLEDGE shall choose a new big brother from the ACTIVE BROTHERHOOD.</li>

<li>If the pledge enters into any negotiations for securing membership in any other social fraternity.</li>
<li>If the pledge evidences unwillingness to conform to directions given for preparation for initiation.</li>

<li>By decision of the Judicial Board.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>If, at anytime during a PLEDGE&#8217;s pledgeship, any ACTIVE BROTHER feels that a PLEDGE should be expelled for any of the reason listed in Paragraph 1, then that BROTHER may bring up a motion proposing that the pledge be expelled. The following guidelines will govern such, motions:

<ol>

The vote will consist of two options: a YES vote, which is a vote in favor of the motion to expel the PLEDGE, or a NO vote, which is a vote against the motion to expel the PLEDGE.

</ol>

<h5 id="law2:suspensionandexpulsionofbrothers">Law 2: Suspension and Expulsion of BROTHERs</h5>

<ol>
<li>A BROTHER may bring up a motion to grant PERSONAL LEAVE. A motion to grant PERSONAL LEAVE must include a recommended BROTHER’S KEEPER and requires a THREE-FOURTHS MAJORITY of the ACTIVE BROTHERHOOD, excepting the vote of the person in question. The purpose of this liaison is to encourage continued participation, and to help resolve the issues which lead to the motion to grant PERSONAL LEAVE.
